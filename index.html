        <h1>WHAT IS PARLOUR WORSHIP?</h1>
        <p>Parlour Worship, Word and Prayers is a platform where we pray, worship and also search
            through God's Word in order to activate God's promises and see it evidently (with proof) fulfilled in our
            lives. It is a platform for activation.
            We've come to understand from Scripture that no matter the principle you know, it takes the breath of God
            (encounters) for
            activation. <br>
            <br> For instance, we saw that in the life of Jacob, Gideon, Abraham, Enoch, Abraham, Zaccheus e.t.c.
            Encounter is therefore, key in making the most of our destiny.
            We have discovered that one of the keys to attract heavens attention is through:

        <ol>
            <li>Prayers as in the case of Jabez in 1 Chronicles 4:9-10</li>
            <li>Worship as in the case of the Israelites in 2 Chronicles 20:2</li>
            <li>The ministry of the Word as seen in Acts 4:6</li>
        </ol>
        </p>


        <p>
        <h2>Our Focus</h2>
        <ol>

            <li>We seek to establish a solid and unquenchable relationship with Jesus.</li>
            <li>We seek to stir up a burning desire in men through God's word that will make men go on personal quest to
                know God and
                also understand their purpose as there are many destinies tied to each one of us.</li>
            <li>We seek to attract heaven's attention in our day to day affairs.</li>
            <li>To understand God's perfect will and walk therein</li>
            <li>Believe God that giants who will take over territories shall rise among us</li>
            <li>To activate God's promises from his Word into our individual lives</li>
            <li>Reaching out to the lost and getting them established in the faith</li>
        </ol>
        </p>

        <h3>Please Note</h3>
        <p>We are a people seeking God's face for intervention in our generation. We stand as a token to see God's
            kingdom come on earth as it is in heaven. <b>We are not running a church.</b> It's not a meeting of perfect
            people but of thirsty and desperate people trusting God to help us rise as agents in this generation.
            <i>No man is permitted to die without impacting his/her generation.</i> Therefore, let your light so shine.
            Remain blessed!!!
        </p>
